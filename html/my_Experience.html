                        <p>Before i volunteered I had to Go to their main store in Wisbech for an induction where i was taught their health and safety and their policies.</p>
                        <p>During my time as a volunteer at Cambridgeshire Community Reuse & Recycling Network I had to work with others to move, label, mix and recycle paint.</p>
                        <p>The first day I worked I had to move 5Litre bucket of paint for the first half of the day. After, I had to "Condense" paint which was a process were I sorted paints by their colour</p>
                        <p>Once they were sorted I chose an empty 9Litre bucket of a certain colour then pour recycled 5Litre buckets of the same colour into the 9 litre until it was full.</p>
                        <p>This is where i logged my hours.</p>
