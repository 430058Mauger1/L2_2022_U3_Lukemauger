                    <div class="five"><p>The universe began 13.7 billion years ago in the big bang, at the time the universe was hotter and denser than anything we can imagine when it exploded the universe was created in a fraction of a second from the size of a single atom to the size of a galaxy, it kept expanding getting faster and faster it is still expanding today, scientists still don’t know what makes it expand but astronomers theorize that there is a force that is pulling everything apart. 
                        Overtime The universe was split in three different stages the first stage is the pre-compression era the, the second era is the compression era, and the third era is the post-compression era the three eras were split based on how energy and matter interacted.

                    <div class="five"><p>The galaxy's core lays 26,000 light-years away and contains a supermassive black hole, if the voyager were to travel to the centre of the galaxy it would take it 450,000,000 years but if it could travel at light speed it would take 26,000 years however this is impossible due to special relativity. 
                        <p>The Milky way also contains over two hundred billion stars and has enough dust, gas and resources to make billions more.
                        But The most common stars in the galaxy are red dwarfs, a cool star about a tenth the mass of the sun. Once thought unsuitable for potential life-bearing planets because such bodies would have to be too close to meet the criteria, red dwarfs are now considered potential suspects.</p> 
                        <p>The Milky Way is on track to collide and merge with its nearest neighbour, the Andromeda galaxy, in about 4 billion years. The galaxies will pass through each other, get snapped back together by gravity, and eventually merge cores.</p>

                    <div class="five"><p>Black holes are extremely dense points in space that beyond a certain point everything will fall into it and its pull is so powerful not even light can escape. 
                        They are created when stars with a certain mass die and explode in a massive explosion known as a supernova when it explodes it pushes out its stellar matter out and all that is left is its core when the star was alive the force that powered it kept it from collapsing in on itself but with all of its fuel gone there is nothing left to power it so it’s core collapses.</p>
                         
                        <p>Stellar black holes range from five to several tens of solar masses 
                        Supermassive black holes are the largest type of black hole, and they have millions to billions of times the mass of our sun.</p> 
                         
                        <p>The largest black hole known right now is Abell 85, Abell 85 is roughly the size of our solar system but packs the mass of 40 billion suns.</p>
                         
                        <p>Black holes are also invisible because nothing, not even light can escape so it can only be detected by its gravitational effects on nearby objects.</p> 
                         
                        <p>What is even weirder as you get closer to a black hole, the flow of time slows down, compared to the flow of time far from the black hole. According to Einstein's theory, any massive body, including the Earth, produces this effect. However, the Earth's gravity is so weak compared to a black hole that the slowing of time is not noticeable, but the effect has been confirmed using sensitive instruments. For example, at sea level, you age one-billionth of a second less every year than you would if you lived on top of Mt. Everest.</p>

                    <div class="five"><p>Black holes can die in a process known as evaporation however it can take a very long time depending on the mass of the black hole. In 1974, Stephen Hawking made one of his most famous predictions that black holes will eventually evaporate and die 
                        According to Hawking’s theory, black holes are not perfectly black and that they emit particles. This radiation, hawking believed could eventually siphon enough energy and mass away from the black hole to make them disappear. This radiation came to be known as Hawking radiation.

                        Another theory is the fission theory when in the eighteen hundreds George Darwin the son of Charles Darwin suggested that the earth might have spun so fast that a piece of it was torn off and held in place by the Earths gravity.

                    <div class="five"><p>The Big Crunch is a hypothetical situation for the destiny of the universe, in which the expansion of the universe inverts and the universe collapses, and it could be followed by a rebirth of the universe beginning with another Big Bang.</p>
 
                        <p>If the big rip is the way the universe ends, then all matter of the universe from stars to galaxies and atoms to subatomic particles will be torn apart by the expansion of the universe. the expansion will also eventually tear apart spacetime itself</p>
                        
                        <p>If it ends in the big freeze all matter will expand forever until it reaches a final uniform state and as space and matter gets further and further away matter won't clump together, and no new stars will be created, and the universe will be cold forever</p>
                        
                        <p>Or it could end in decay or vacuum decay which is when the delicate balance between quantum particles breaks down, the Higgs field would break out of its false vacuum in a domino effect throughout the universe called vacuum decay. A bubble of vacuum decay would spread throughout the universe at the speed of light As it passes through, all matter, the forces of the universe would cease to function as it currently does.</p>

                    <div class="five"><p>Interstellar travel is the travel between stars, and it is mostly thought to be impossible because the distance between stars is just so vast that our rockets just can't travel them in our lifetimes, however, multiple ways have been put forward by scientist’s which could move close to the speed of light or perhaps even faster.</p>
 
                        <p>Like Nuclear propulsion rockets this method was were a rocket would detonate some type of nuclear bomb from out the back at a certain time for thrust, in the 1950’s/60’s the U.S government codenamed the project, project Orion but because of a nuclear test band treaty the project was closed and made illegal by international law. this is plausible and it could reach around 0.33% the speed of light but it has to be used is space because it comes with a lot of nuclear fallout. 
                        </p>
                        <p>And the warp drive or the Alcubierre drive, this idea was proposed by Miguel Alcubierre in 1994 and the basic idea is that the ship could stretch space in a way that makes the space Infront contract and space behind expand so rather than trying to get to the speed of light which is impossible the Alcubierre drive would go around it by bending space-time. But for now, this is purely in the realm of science fiction because it would need enormous amounts of energy to work. 
                        </p>
                        <p>But Both methods would help us travel throughout our entire solar system a lot faster than any methods currently being used.
