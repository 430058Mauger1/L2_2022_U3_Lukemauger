                        During my time as a volunteer at Cambridgeshire Community Reuse & Recycling Network I had to work with others to move, label, mix and recycle paint.
                        Some of the jobs they had me do included labelling buckets, tins and paint brushes with their names prices and other bits of information they needed on their products,
                        Condensing paint, filling paint buckets with paint and moving and loading paints into a delivery van. In total i have worked 58.3 hours at Cambridgeshire Community Reuse &
                        Recycling Network and i have logged all of my hours on my student portal.
